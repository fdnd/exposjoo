        'In addition, our lecturers as well as the Centre for Applied Research (Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries) will give a number of short talks with updates from our field. We will also give our external industry partners the opportunity to get in touch with our students and teachers this evening. In this way, we bring education, research and business around digital design and development together in the Theo Thijssenhuis.'

        'The digital world has a huge impact on everyoneâ€™s life. Booking holidays, ordering taxis and having festival tickets scanned at the entrance: we do almost all of it digitally. Digital products are interwoven with our everyday lives. That is why the world needs skilled and critical designers. Designers who keep asking questions, who dare to say no when necessary and who know how to realise their ideas. We train critical designers who determine and question our digital future. How we commemorate. How we become more sustainable. How we build communities. How we buy and how we eat.',
        'Our students design digital, interactive products. These can include apps, websites, but also tangible installations, augmented and virtual reality applications. Topics such as user-friendliness, privacy, accessibility, inclusivity and sustainability play an important role in this.'

Cynically hoping to receive a 5.5. We can do better, and it\'s not even that hard. And it\'s fun.',

Vasilis will explain, by showing examples from his students, from his own work, and from daily practice, the difference between technical accessibility and genuine usability.'

Additionally, he has established the Immersive Lab and the Audio Lab on the HvA campus. Since 2019, he has been conducting research into creativity in education. As a learning experience designer of the minor Immersive Environments, he has directly applied insights from his research on creativity within this international minor. In 2021 he founded The Institute of Creativity (Tioc), an organization that aims to bring together knowledge about creativity and facilitate creative growth.',
        'Technology is evolving so rapidly, so it\'s really a challenge to train designers. (Hypernovelty) In order to provide a future proof skillset, you should train designers to rehearse the future. Combining storytelling, design by doing, and speculative design using ai, sensors, and projection can help people to spark creative joy and grow in their understanding of human tech interactions. Bart-Jan shows a couple of examples of projects and shows how international students from all kinds of disciplines are being trained in the minor Immersive environments to become creative immersive experience designers.'

        'Technology makes our lives increasingly smoother, faster, and more frictionless. But when everything goes effortlessly, what happens to attention, wonder, and self-determination? In this research project, we investigate how friction â€” friction, inertia, resistance â€” can have a valuable place in technological interaction. Among other things, we look at the rise of generative AI chatbots that are increasingly taking over daily tasks. What does it do to us when technology constantly thinks, feels, and decides for us?',
        'Together with students, we developed FrictionGPT, a chatbot that does not talk to you, but rather confronts, questions, and challenges you. No instant gratification, but space for reflection and deceleration. This idea does not stand alone. In her Friction Manifesto, designer Luna Maurer advocates designs that embrace friction, as a counterbalance to the constant pursuit of convenience. Platforms like Breeze put this into practice by designing social media that are not addictive, but stimulate peace and real connection. What do we want from technology as humans? And does it really make us happier?'
