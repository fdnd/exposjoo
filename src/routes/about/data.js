        'In addition, our lecturers as well as the Centre for Applied Research (Faculty of Digital Media and Creative Industries) will give a number of short talks with updates from our field. We will also give our external industry partners the opportunity to get in touch with our students and teachers this evening.

        'The digital world has a huge impact on everyone’s life. Booking holidays, ordering taxis and having festival tickets scanned at the entrance: we do almost all of it digitally. Digital products are interwoven with our everyday lives. That is why the world needs skilled and critical designers. Designers who keep asking questions, who dare to say no when necessary and who know how to realise their ideas. We train critical designers who determine and question our digital future. How we commemorate. How we become more sustainable. How we build communities. How we buy and how we eat.',
        'Our students design digital, interactive products. These can include apps, websites, but also tangible installations, augmented and virtual reality applications. Topics such as user-friendliness, privacy, accessibility, inclusivity and sustainability play an important role in this.'
